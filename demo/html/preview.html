	<h2>About Us</h2>
   	<p>Your hero is boring if there isn't a lot at stake. And, your article if boring if there's nothing at stake. If what you have to say doesn't matter, why am I read your article? And, if there is nothing at stake, why are you writing it?

What's at stake for this article? Well, if you write horrible introductions, no one will care about your content. If no one cares about your content, your marketing will suffer. If your marketing suffers, you'll lose to your competitors. If you lose to your competitors, you'll eventually lose your job. If you lose your job, you won't be able to pay your car payment, they will repo your car, you will get evicted, you will get hungry, you will... 

Maybe that's being a little too extreme - but you get the point.

If the stakes were, you'll feel better about your intros... no one will care.
